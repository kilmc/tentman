## UX Improvements

- Store the changes that you haven't pushed to a branch in some kind of store so that if you realise you've made a mistake before you either publish or save to a preview branch it will allow you to go back and edit. Currently it clears the changes from the form. I would like to fix that.
- Delete should stage a draft deletion change, it should not immediately push a delete commit because you should be able to review the change that's about to happen before the commit happens.

## Future Features

- Config-based theming. Add colors to have the different repos look a little different while you're editing.
- Documentation pages
- Logged out Homepage that walks you through the functionality of the project
- Add content grouping to put content, nav, header and footer or other things in logical sections.
